Background: 

This app is a choose your-own adventure that runs on broswer. 

Game Description & Overview: 

In this text-based adventure you set off in a very peculiar store, owned by your friendly new companin. They will guide you through their vast collection of strange trinkets and inventions. Your goal is to get to the end of the story and experience your companions magnum-opus.  


Rules: 

After entering your desired 'Player Name', you'll be prompted by a chapter and story text. Each prompt has three choices and destinations to select from. Choose correctly and you'll get to continue the story. Choose incorrectly and you'll have to restart from the first chapter.

Ice-box Goals/ Improvements to Come: 

As I develop my skills, I'd like to eventually add more functionality and styling to this app. On a short term scale, I'd like to add a navbar that allows you to move through checkpoints, as develop a 'soft loss' that allows you to navigate through those checkpoints rather than restart from chapter 1. My hope in writing this code the way that I have, is that I have set myself up to easily incorporate three.js scenes inside of each of these story objects. I'd like to render a relative simple scene of the text narration. In conjuction with this, I'd like to develop a Player Creation function using something like Ready Player Me if possible.
