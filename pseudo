// provide a <input> space for the user to submit custom answers
  // store user submissions
    // eg userName 
// once user submits valid name (characters only)
  // present user with multiple choices to begin the story 
  // provide the user with a 45 second timer on choices when they have to submit custom answers
    // if the user fails to submit a response by the end of the timer, they should lose for not being actively engaged in the story
// two choices will always end the story or "lose" the game but they will output different results 
  
// one of the choices will allow the user to continue the story to it's conclusion 

// styling should be simple for now 
  // colors and images that match the tone and plot of the story will accompany each choice the user can make
